Sylt is a statically checked and dynamically typed reference counted programming
language made for game jams.

For information about how to use the language and get started with writing games
in it, check out our language documentation at https://sylt.rs.

## Endgame

A language that has some form of static typechecking, is easy and fast to work
in. Performance should be good enough that you don't really have to worry about
it.

Dreams exist of automatically recompiling and updating the game while the game is running.
