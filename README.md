# Sylt-lang
-----------
Sylt is a statically-checked dynamically typed, reference counted programming
language made for GameJams.


## Why does this exist? Why not use X-lang?
Pfft! Why not?
    

## Getting started
Sylt is written entirely in Rust. Pointing to this Git-repo 
in your Cargo.toml is the easiet way. Alternatively you can
build the interpreter and run your own programs from there.


## Endgame
A language that has some form of static typechecking, is easy and fast to work
in. Performance should be good enought that you don't really have to worry
about it.

Dreams also exist of automatically updating the game when files are changed.
