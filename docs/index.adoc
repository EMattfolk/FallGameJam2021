= Sylt

Sylt is a statically checked and dynamically typed programming language made for
game jams. Working in Sylt should be a pain- and fearless experience. If it
isn't, please file an
https://github.com/FredTheDino/sylt-lang/issues/new/choose[issue].

== Installing the compiler

The simplest way of getting the binary is to download a tagged release from
https://github.com/FredTheDino/sylt-lang/releases/.

If you can't download a pre-built (due to a different architecture or operating
system) or don't want to use pre-built binaries, you will need a (recent) Rust
installation and the source code.

If you don't have Rust installed, consider using https://rustup.rs/ and
selecting the latest stable version.

With Rust installed, run
`cargo install sylt --git https://github.com/FredTheDino/sylt-lang.git` to
install the latest and greatest from the main branch. If you want a tagged
version you can add `--tag <tag-name>` to the command, as in
`cargo install sylt --git https://github.com/FredTheDino/sylt-lang.git --tag v0.1.0`.

You can also download the source code and build it locally with
`cargo install --path sylt`.

== Writing a simple program

Put the following well known hello world into a file called `hello.sy`.

[source, sylt]
----
start :: fn do
    print("Hello world!")
end
----

Try to run the program by running `sylt hello.sy` in a terminal!

[source, shell]
----
$ sylt hello.sy
Hello world!
----

Let's walk through what happens in this program.

[source, sylt]
----
start :: fn do           // <1>
    print("Hello world") // <2>
end
----

<1> Define the program entry point.
<2> Greet the world.

Much like `main` from some other languages, a Sylt program requires an entry
point (`start`) to start in.

// more here? probably

== Writing a simple game

With the world greeting out of the way, we can get a simple game going.

// TODO: wait for l√∂ve
